# Workspace-Switcher

Just a simple bash script that uses wmctrl (sudo apt install wmctrl) to switch between workspaces.

Just change the `$WORKSPACE_COUNT` variable at the top of the script to match the number of workspaces you have.

I used this script by setting a keyboard shortcut to call this script to cycle workspaces since xubuntu didn't have an option to customize the default `CTRL-ALT-<arrow key>` shortcut.

Couldn't find an easy solution when googling so I hacked this together. Hope it helps!
