# Workspace-Switcher

Just 2 simple bash scripts that uses wmctrl (sudo apt install wmctrl) to switch between workspaces.

Just change the `$WORKSPACE_COUNT` variable at the top of the script to match the number of workspaces you have.

I used this script by setting keyboard shortcuts to call these scripts to cycle workspaces since xubuntu didn't have an option to customize the default `CTRL-ALT-<arrow key>` shortcut.

Couldn't find an easy solution when googling so I hacked this together. Hope it helps!

Just set the keyboard shortcut to call this script and make the shortcut whatever you want!
